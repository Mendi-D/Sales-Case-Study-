# Sales-Case-Study-

I have been provided with a generic, simulated dataset “Sales Case Study.csv”, which indicates the daily trading information for a large retail store, aggregated for the day. The data is only for one of the products sold at this store.
Each record contains the:

•Date = The day on which the sales occurred

•Sales = Total Rand value of the sales that occurred

•Cost of Sales = Total Rand value of the cost of sales that occurred

•Quantity Sold = Total number of units that have been sold
